## Sacramental Program for Children

For Catholic children attending the Sacred Heart Primary School, preparation for the Sacraments of Reconciliation (Year 3), Holy Communion (Year 4) and Confirmation (Year 5 or 6) are done through the school program.

Children attending non-Catholic schools who wish to receive these sacraments in our parish must enroll for a formation program which is offered annually for Reconciliation and Holy Communion, and biannually for Confirmation. Enrollment forms are available in the church foyer during the month of February.

## Visiting the Sick

Elderly and sick parishioners who cannot attend Sunday Mass at the church may request home visits by the priest or lay minister for a visit, prayer or Holy Communion. Please contact the Parish Office providing name and address of people requesting visits.

## Anointing of the Sick

The Catholic Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, formerly known as Last Rites or Extreme Unction, is a ritual of healing appropriate not only for physical but also for mental and spiritual sickness. Please contact the Parish Office to be put in touch with a priest to make arrangements for this Sacrament.

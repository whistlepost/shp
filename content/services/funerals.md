The death of a loved one is an especially sensitive time for families and friends.  
  
Our parish works with the family and the Funeral Director in planning the details of the funeral.  
  
The Rite of Christian Funerals allows great involvement for the family in choosing appropriate readings from Sacred Scripture and the various prayers and hymns used for the celebration of a funeral as well as various types of involvement by family and friends in the celebration itself.  
  
Your funeral director will normally make contact with the Parish Office on your behalf to determine the date and time of the funeral.  
  
The priest will work with you in planning the details of the funeral itself.

+++
November 1 is marked annually in the Catholic liturgical calendar as a day to remember and venerate saints from around the world and throughout history – not only those known and canonised, but also all unknown as well.

In the 4th century, All Saints’ Day traditions served to honour the great number of individuals martyred for their faith during the persecutions in the late Roman Empire. It was during the 8th century that Pope Gregory III declared that all saints be remembered on November 1.

All Saints’ Day is an opportune time to consider the example saints offer us today and to reflect on how we can imitate their holiness. As Pope Benedict XVI remarked in 2011, All Saints’ Day calls us “to see the Church… as Christ wanted it, that is, as the communion of saints”. All Souls’ Day follows All Saints’ Day on November 2, when Catholics remember, pray and offer Mass for the souls in Purgatory, that they may be purified and attain the perfect salvation in heaven.

If anyone wishes to offer Mass, please write down the name/s of the deceased person/s and drop it in the Presbytery letterbox together with your offering before the 2nd of November. Masses for the deceased will be celebrated every day from Monday 2nd to Sunday 8th November.

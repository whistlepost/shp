October is recognised in the Catholic Church as World Mission Month, a time when Catholics all over the world join to support and celebrate global missionary work. Catholic Mission, as the Australian arm of the Pontifical Mission Societies, plays a vital role. 

'What Catholic Mission and the international network of Pontifical Mission Societies can do, is to help some of the most vulnerable people in the world', says Catholic Mission Victorian Director, Kevin Meese. 'This year we focus on the essential work of priests, religious and lay missionariesin Cambodia, supporting people with disability and their families.' 

In north-west Cambodia, The Arrupe Centre and Outreach Program is providing learning and growth opportunities for the community, still affected by landmine incidents and associated illnesses. This centre is managed by Bishop Enrique "Kike" Figaredo Alvargonzalez in the Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang. For over 20 years, Bishop ‘Kike’ and his team have been working to advocate for people with disability. This program is just one of the many examples of the global work supported by Catholic Mission.

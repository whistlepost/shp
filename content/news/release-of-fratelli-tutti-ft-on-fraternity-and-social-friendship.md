Dear Sisters and Brothers in Christ,

“..if the music of the Gospel ceases to resonate in our very being, we will lose the joy born of compassion, the tender love born of trust, the capacity for reconciliation that has its source in our knowledge that we have been forgiven and sent forth. If the music of the Gospel ceases to sound in our homes, our public squares, our workplaces, our political and financial life, then we will no longer hear the strains that challenge us to defend the dignity of every man and woman”. \[FT 277\]

On this Feast of St Francis of Assisi, passionate and poetic missionary of the Gospel, I share with you the Holy Father’s awaited Encyclical, “Fratelli Tutti – on Fraternity and Social Friendship”, which extends the guiding paths laid down by Evangelii Gaudium and Laudato Si’:

Please click here for ‘[Fratelli Tutti](http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html)’

I urge you to read it, and to then return to it with time and space to draw more deeply into the riches within. Situated as we are in the latter stages of this Pandemic, it offers much that we might embrace as we determine who we are as people of God in Melbourne, and how we might emerge from this time of exile to go on mission into the world with the beating heart of Jesus.

The Holy Father speaks to us as ‘fellow travellers...children of the same earth… brothers and sisters all.’ Our own Saint Mary of the Cross also spoke to our shared pilgrimage as being ‘but travellers here..’. We are not on this path alone, but together as humanity, accompanied by the One who through His great sacrifice, calls us to live always with love, mercy and compassion for all.

Yours in peace and fraternity

\+ Archbishop Peter Comensoli

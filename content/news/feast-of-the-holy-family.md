# The Fifth Day of Christmas

Sunday 27th December is the feast day of the Holy Family, but also every family's feast day, since the Holy Family is the patron and model of all Christian families. It should be a huge family feast, since it is devoted entirely to the Holy Family as a model for the Christian family life. 

As Rev. Edward Sutfin states: "The children must learn to see in their father the foster-father St. Joseph, and the Blessed Mother as the perfect model for their own mother. The lesson to be learned is both practical and theoretical, in that the children must learn how to obey and to love their parents in thought, word and action, just as Christ was obedient to Mary and Joseph. Helping mother in the kitchen and in the house work, and helping father in his odd jobs about the home thus take on a new significance by being performed in a Christ-like spirit."

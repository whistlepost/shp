Pope Francis will travel to Assisi, October 3, to sign an
encyclical on the social, political and economic obligations
that flow from a belief that all people are children
of God and therefore brothers and sisters to one another.
The Vatican press office, confirming the pope's trip, said
the document will be titled "Fratelli Tutti" in Italian or
"Brothers and Sisters All."
The document will indicate to the world a style for the
future and will give the church and people of goodwill
the responsibility for building it together. The pope is
clearly inspired by Francis of Assisi who, in following
Jesus, recognised in fraternity, lived under the sign of
mutual and loving service, the horizon of a fulfilled and
happy humanity.

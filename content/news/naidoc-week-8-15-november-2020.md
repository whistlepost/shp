# Always was, Always will be

The National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee (NAIDOC) theme this year is **‘Always was, Always will be’**. 

‘Together in the Spirit’ was the theme for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Sunday - celebrated in July this year - and it is still an important concept to focus upon during the rescheduled NAIDOC week. 

Today we acknowledge the ancient cultures of our First Nations here in Australia. We celebrate that God has always been present with, and loved, our First Peoples. 

So often others have decided what they thought best for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As Catholics, moved by the principles of the dignity of all human beings as equals, we undertake to support and walk with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters. They need to determine their own destiny. We offer support in this self-determination out of a profound love and respect based on our Christian belief. 

Our First Nations Peoples face many challenges, including generational trauma.

• In Christ we find hope and know that God walks with us.

• As the First Peoples of this land they hold a special place in our hearts.

• There is much that we can learn from them. We need to listen.

• Christ brings all cultures to fullness. Christ reached out to others; he did not just wait for them to come to Him. Following His example we reach out in love and mutual respect to our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island brothers and sisters.

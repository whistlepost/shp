## Vision

Sacred Heart Parish is a Catholic community, growing in the love of God, sustained by the Word, and enriched by God’s many gifts. We are called to live out our faith through worshipping together, welcoming and helping one another, being open to the challenges of the world and embracing differences, caring for God’s creation and facing our future with hope.

# About Sacred Heart Preston

Sacred Heart Parish is a Catholic community; growing in the love of God, sustained by the word, and enriched by God's many gifts.

We are called to live out our faith through, worshiping together, welcoming and helping one another, being open to the challenges of the world and embracing differences, caring for God's children and facing our future with hope.

Following the way of Jesus, we strive to create vibrant liturgical celebrations, to build a hospitable and caring community, to respect and appreciate different cultures and values, to reach out to all people with compassion, and to promote and care for our environment

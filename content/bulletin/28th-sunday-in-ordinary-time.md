# All are Called, Few are Chosen

[Full Bulletin](http://nebula.wsimg.com/181182866784f23f7dd943321ff58c82?AccessKeyId=2AF9533DEE1BA9433B58&disposition=0&alloworigin=1)

In today’s gospel parable, the king sends out his servants, referring to the long line of prophets sent to the people of Israel calling them to love and service. “But they would not come,” says Jesus. 

Other servants are sent out. “Tell those who have been invited that I have my banquet all prepared… Everything is ready. Come to the wedding.” When God calls there is always a sense of urgency. The only time to respond is NOW. But that is not what happens here. Those invited were simply not interested. They reacted in two ways. Either they were too involved in their own worldly interests to be bothered or else they seized the king’s messengers, “maltreated them and killed them”. 

After the treatment his messengers received, “the king was furious,” Jesus says. “He despatched his troops, destroyed those murderers and burnt their town.” 

With the refusal of those originally invited, the king once again repeats that the wedding is “ready”. The servants are now sent out, not to the houses of the wealthy and respectable, but to the “crossroads” where large crowds of ordinary people would gather. No exceptions are made. All are invited, good and bad alike, until the wedding hall is filled. 

There is now no “chosen people”, no elite. The Church calls all to enter. It is, and always will be, a Church of both saints and sinners. It would be so nice to have a parish consisting only of totally dedicated Christians but it would not be truly representative of the love of God reaching out to all. It would not be truly a catholic church, a church for all. 

The last part of the parable seems a gross contradiction. It seems so unjust. Having gone out to the highways and byways to bring in all without exception, how can one justify tossing out someone because he does not have a “wedding garment”? Yet, some reflection will reveal that it is really part of the same teaching. The Jewish leaders rejected Jesus. Other people, outcasts and pagans, were invited to take their place at the banquet. However, it is not enough just to be present at the banquet. One was expected to come properly dressed and not in dirty and untidy clothes. This would show a total lack of respect for one’s fellow-guests. 

While many, in fact all, are called to the banquet, they are expected to behave as wedding guests. In practical terms, while the Church opens wide its arms to the sinner, it expects that he /she makes an effort to repent and put on the “wedding garment”.

“Which of the two did his father's will?" This question posed by Jesus in today’s gospel touches a fundamental human dilemma: the gap between words and deeds, be-tween intention and decision, between desires expressed in the calm of reflection and the quick fixes of lived life. This is a gap we all know: our deeds often fail to match our words!

But the gospel raises also more profound questions for us than simply reminding us to practice what we preach. It poses us a series of interconnected challenges.

1\. There is the challenge to act with integrity: bring the inward person and the out-ward person into harmony. This is not simply the moral and the psychological chal-lenge of integrity, but is at the heart of right living and faith. This quest for harmony takes place in the presence of God: we need to have integrity not just in ourselves, but to have integrity in the divine presence be-fore whom we are trans-parent.

2\. We know that integrity is a quest for wholeness: that the various aspects of our lives should be con-nected up to one another. Wholeness involves us as individuals, as members of families and communi-ties, and its links keep spreading out.

3\. We are called by God to be people of obedient faith, and that means that we are not just dealing with a religion of ideas or good feelings. Anything declared as believed is tested in so far as it informs our commitment to the creation.

4\. The obedient son in today’s gospel first rebelled and then recognised the path that he should follow. Being disciples involves taking this second look at our actions. We all like to declare our independence and to state boldly that ‘We will not serve!’ It is part of our human nature to be aware of our independence and freedom. Yet, we as disciples have to balance this with our appreciation of the limitations of our knowledge and of the Wisdom that created us. Integrating awareness of our freedom with our acknowledgment of the Christ as our teacher is an essential part of com-pleteness and wholeness. It is part of the wisdom and integrity of holiness.

5\. There is a challenge to each of us to acknowledge the generosity of God. We all tend to think of ourselves as models of humanity, and as Christians, we even tend to think of ourselves as model disciples. But here lies a great illusion! Those whom Je-sus met that were self-satisfied, he challenged with questions. Those whom the self-satisfied automatically excluded, the tax collectors and prostitutes, he sat and ate with that they might come to know the goodness and forgiveness of God.

# Called to be Holy

[Full Bulletin](http://nebula.wsimg.com/27a2af56388b628f79af75a04e530ad1?AccessKeyId=2AF9533DEE1BA9433B58&disposition=0&alloworigin=1)

When we think about holiness, many of us tend to think that only extraordinary people are holy people. Perhaps that’s a way of defending against the idea that God is asking us to be holy too. Or we think that holy people are those special ones in monasteries and convents, gliding silently around in cloistered gardens while reciting their prayer books, with little birds fluttering around St. Francis of Assisi and the like. That however, is not the way God sees it. The Book of Revelations tells us that a large number, innumerable, all of them clothed in white robes manifesting sanctity and victory. The Church teaches us that God’s call for holiness is universal. Everyone is called to live in God’s love and make His love real in the lives of those around them. Holiness isn’t something that is distant and far removed from us. On the contrary, it is near and close at hand.

Holiness isn’t some strange way of living. However remarkable Saint Mother Tere-sa of Calcutta’s life was, she continued to live in the crowded streets among the poorest people of Calcutta. Holiness means living whole live in integrity and truth while being close with God. In the words of the Gospel the ‘blessed’ are those spiritually detached from goods and possessions, the merciful, just and pure of heart, the peace makers, the humble and God-like persons. They suffered for Christ and offered their life to him.

Today’s feast is first of all an occasion for great thanksgiving. Ultimately, it is our feast since all of us are called to be saints. It is altogether reasonable to think that many of our family, relatives and friends who have gone before us are being celebrated today. We will be with our parents, our grandparents, as well as those members of our families who sacrificed their own comfort and resources in order that we might have our Catholic Faith. They are the nuns and teachers who taught us about Jesus Christ, about the Sacraments and the life of God we receive in Mass and Holy Communion. They are our friends who supported us in our choices to do what is decent, what is good, what is pure, and what is noble and best. They are priests who inspired us, prayed for us, and prayed with us. They are people who lived down the street and dropped everything to come and help us, and to care for us when we were sick, or when we were in trouble. May God be glorified in his saints!

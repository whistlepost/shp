The Gospel parable of the ten virgins represents the “Chosen People of God” who were waiting for the Messiah to come. Some were prepared to welcome him even if he was late. Others were not. Are we prepared to meet him when he comes? How are we to re-main ever prepared?

Watchful and wise Christians find Jesus in the most ordinary experiences of daily living — in the people they meet, the events that take place, and the situations in which they find themselves, and they carefully make their daily choices for God. Watchful and wise Christians are ready to put the commandment of love into practice by showing kindness, mercy and forgiveness. They are sure that their ‘Lamps’ are ready for the end of their lives: Spiritual readiness, preparation, and growth are the result of intended habits built into their life. They do not depend on a Sunday Mass only or morning prayer to provide all their spiritual needs. They do not depend on retreats or workshops only to provide them with spiritual development. The meeting of spiritual needs and spiritual development itself come through routine, everyday attention to the way they live their Christian lives — making sure they have enough oil or spiritual fuel: oil of compassion and mercy, oil of patience, sympathy, love and forgiveness.

We open ourselves to receive these graces by taking time for prayer and by being alone with God; by reading God’s Word; by living a sacramental life; by offering acts of service to others; by moral faithfulness, by loving obedience, and by spending time with other Catholics for mutual prayer, study and encouragement. When we receive the graces we need, we thank God for his generous love. As taking these ways becomes habitual, they cease to be a struggle and begin to be a source of strength and blessing.

They make our lives powerful against the challenges of the post-modern world.

Today’s parable warns us that there are certain things which cannot be obtained at the last minute: a good relationship with God, good character, merits from good deeds of sharing and forgiving love, and humble service done to others. The parable also warns us of certain foundations of Christian life cannot be borrowed: relationship with God, ideal character, faith.

St Ignatius of Loyola’s famous prayer is the prayer of the follower of Jesus; ‘Lord, teach me to know you more, love you more and serve you more faithfully in my life.’ The “more” indicates that our earthly life is always in process, never a finished product: like love and friendship it grows in our lives. Jesus is never gone from us. Risen from the dead he is always alive, always new. Our reading of the Gospel, our sharing at Mass and the sacraments and our personal prayer keep this relationship always alive, always new.

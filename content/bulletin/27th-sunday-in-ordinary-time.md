# Sent to Produce Good Fruits

[Full Bulletin](http://nebula.wsimg.com/e21879a5ab7f0ea156dc626901dc1253?AccessKeyId=2AF9533DEE1BA9433B58&disposition=0&alloworigin=1)

Two main thoughts come to mind while reflecting on the gospel parable today. First, the infinite goodness, patience and the mercy of God in his dealing with humankind and secondly, the unsounded depth of wickedness and ingratitude to which people can sink.

To his chosen people God had given every good thing indicated in the image of the fertile vineyard: his revelation, protection, new land at Canaan and the promise of the messiah. But they had other plans and they wanted a kingdom on earth. Yet we see God’s patience with them, forgiving them, again and again pardoning their infidelities, sending his messengers and kings and taking care of them. All God asked in return was their cooperation. However, when the prophets were sent to them as God’s messengers they refused to accept them and did not listen to their warnings. Finally, the landowner, God, sent His only beloved Son Jesus to them, saying, “They will respect my Son.” Rather than believing and accepting the teachings of Jesus, the Son of God and the promised Messiah, the chief priests and the Pharisees plotted against Him and killed Him.

Today, we are God’s people. We are the tenants in the God’s vineyard. He expects us to work in his vineyard and to produce fruit that will endure. The question to ask ourselves today is: How are we doing? How much better are we than the chief priests, the elders, the Scribes and the Pharisees? We are especially privileged by baptism to be called to work in the Lord’s vineyard. Time and time again we are invited to gather together to hear the Gospel message and to make it part of our lives. We are all called to be active members of the Body of Christ, the Church. Over the centuries, a number of prophets in our Christian communities have been rejected, abused and even killed. We think of Joan of Arc, Thomas More, and Oliver Plunkett and, in our own times, Bishop Oscar Romero, Martin Luther King, the countless victims of violence in Central and South America, in Africa and Northern Ireland. All these martyrs have one thing in common. They were killed not by pagans but by fellow-Christians, tenants in the Lord’s vineyard.

This week, let us all take a few moments to review our status before God, asking ourselves how active are we in the Lord’s vineyard. As we slowly reopen from the COVID-19 lockdown let us not remain indifferent to God’s invitation to become vital tenants and produce fruits that will enrich our community and the Church.

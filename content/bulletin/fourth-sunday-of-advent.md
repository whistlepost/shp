# Glory to God

[Full Bulletin](http://nebula.wsimg.com/1141ddbf4b04daf941555da03fec6410?AccessKeyId=2AF9533DEE1BA9433B58&disposition=0&alloworigin=1)

The theme that runs through today’s readings is giving Glory to God. King David builds a temple to the glory of God. St Paul exhorts us to give glory to God; and in the gospel, Mary gives glory to God by accepting his plan for her and dedicating her entire life to God.

How can we give glory to God?

Following the examples of King David and Mary in today’s readings, we can glorify God by recognising our own lowly beginnings, recognising that who and what we are, we attained by God’s grace and for this we are grateful to him. David recognised that he was a simple shepherd of his father’s flock, before God chose him to be the great king of Israel. And looking at Mary, she acknowledged before the angel Gabriel that she was the ‘handmaid’ of the Lord.

Accepting God’s plan for us and allowing him to work in and through us is another way of glorifying God. When the angel announced to Mary that God chose her to become the mother of his Son, not fully understanding what this message meant, but fully trusting God, she responded: ‘Let it be done to me according to your word’. And so, she availed herself like an instrument in God’s hand.

We can give glory to God by using our resources for the works of God. King David decided to use the riches of his kingdom to build a temple to honour God. Of course God does not need our material resources, but to use them or contribute them to help spreading the good news, to promote worship of God, to help those in need, etc., we give glory to God.

Another example of glorifying God we can learn from David and Mary, is believing that God can do more than we expect. While God empowered the young David to kill lions and bears, he believed that God would empower him to defeat the feared by all, Goliath. Mary, in turn, in accepting the assurance of angel Gabriel that ‘with God nothing is impossible’. She believed that she would conceive without knowing a man and give birth to the Son of God!

We also give God glory when we believe that he can do more in our lives than we ask for or can dream of, for nothing is impossible with God! When we lead our lives to the glory of God, he glorifies us even more. Therefore, in all circumstances, good or bad, let us give glory to God who gives us the strength to live according to the Good News…

Glory be to the Father, glory be to the Son, glory be to the Spirit, all glory to our God!
